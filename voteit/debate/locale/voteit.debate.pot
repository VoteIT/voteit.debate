#. Default: Using more than one speaker list will prioritise anyone who has
#. spoken less than someone else, but only up to number of lists.
#. <br/><br/>Example: When using 2 speaker lists, someone who hasn't spoken
#. will get to speak before everyone who's spoken 1 or more times. However,
#. when entering the queue someone who's spoken 2 times and 4 will be treated
#. equally.
