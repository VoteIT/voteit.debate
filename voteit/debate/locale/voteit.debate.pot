#. Default: Using more than one speaker list will prioritise anyone who has spoken
#. less than someone else, but only up to number of lists. <br/><br/>Example: When
#. using 2 speaker lists, someone who hasn't spoken will get to speak before
#. everyone who's spoken 1 or more times. However, when entering the queue someone
#. who's spoken 2 times and 4 will be treated equally.
